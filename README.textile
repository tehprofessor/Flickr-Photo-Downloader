h1. Flickr Photo Downloader v. 0.1

p. This is REALLY simple, but effective, flickr downloader
You can download by: *(a)* tags or *(b)* group (through users)
It will create a directroy with the name of the tag or group
and place the photos there. There is no option to write by
filename. You'll need to uncomment the method you wish to use
before you run the script. (scroll to the bottom)

h2. HOW TO USE:

p. Follow the prompts... When it asks to CONTINUE, just press enter. If something is wrong,
issue an interrupt with ctrl+c to stop the script. I'm using gets just to pause incase
it's not doing what you expected. Your input means nothing ;)



h3. TAGS

p. To download a tag's first 100 photos, simply uncomment
line #90: 

bq. Line 129 (before): #find_and_download

bq. Line 129  (after):  find_and_download

p. Then, run the script:

bq. ruby download-flickr-photos.rb

p. Then type in the tags seperated by commas

bq. space, hipsters, beer, girls with cigarettes

p. Voila! Sit back and wait.



h3. GROUPS

Fleakr doesn't support finding by group ID (or I didn't see the option)
so you must access the group through a Flickr user.
Simply uncomment line 125:

(before)

bq. Line 130 : #group_download

(after)

bq. Line 130 :  group_download

p. Then, run the script:

bq. ruby download-flickr-photos.rb

p. It will ask you for the username and
group name EXACTLY as it appears on flickr.
